### Description
Common coding patterns for new programmers to copy.  
Focused on html, css, and javascript.  

### Where to start
1. **[Download](https://github.com/rockysims/_patterns/archive/master.zip)** the master branch and unzip it.
2. Open learningMaterial/code/vanilla/_start.html in a browser.
3. Compare the html file with the browser console.
4. Play with the code until you understand what it's doing.
5. Go on to the next html file (and repeat from step 3).

### Guiding Principles
- Hands on. A runnable, editable file for each concept.
- Show don't tell. Avoid explanations written in english.
- Design for copy & paste. Minimal, self explanatory examples.
- Prioritize density. Exclude less common variations and avoid repetition.
- Assume the reader has seen it all before but needs a reminder.
