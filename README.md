### Description
Common coding patterns for new programmers to copy.
Focused on html, css, and javascript.

### Guiding Principles
- Show don't tell. Avoid explanations written in english.
- Design for copy & paste. Minimal, self explanatory examples.
- Prioritize density. Exclude less common variations and avoid repetition.
- Assume the reader has seen and understood it all before but has forgotten.

### Wish List
- wrap javascript examples in functions with /** */ explaining it?
- common ide text manipulation/navigation tactics with exercises
- coding exercises using only patterns demonstrated here
- walkthrough for deploying to free web hosting
- vscode setup guide on youtube with timestamps to the 
    micro demonstrations:
    - download and install
    - settings change: save on lose focus
    - shortcut change: for navigate forward/backward to opt + cmd + rigth/left arrow (and delete old meanings)
    - create new project
    - create new file
    - create index.html and add main.js
