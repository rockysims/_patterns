### Description
Common coding patterns for new programmers to copy.  
Focused on html, css, and javascript.  

### Where to start
1. **[Download](https://github.com/rockysims/_patterns/archive/master.zip)** the master branch and unzip it.
2. Open code/vanilla/_start.html in a browser.
3. Compare the html file with the browser console.
4. Play with the code until you understand what it's doing.
5. Go on to the next html file (and repeat from step 3).

### Guiding Principles
- Hands on. A runnable, editable file for each concept.
- Show don't tell. Avoid explanations written in english.
- Design for copy & paste. Minimal, self explanatory examples.
- Prioritize density. Exclude less common variations and avoid repetition.
- Assume the reader has seen it all before but needs a reminder.

### Wish List
- common ide text manipulation/navigation tactics with exercises
- coding exercises needing only patterns demonstrated here
- walkthrough for deploying to free web hosting (heroku.com?)
- vscode setup guide on youtube with timestamps to the 
    micro demonstrations:
    - download and install
    - update the settings (via settings.json file?)
    - settings change: save on lose focus
    - shortcut change: for navigate forward/backward to opt + cmd + rigth/left arrow (and delete old meanings)
    - create new project
    - create new file
    - create index.html and add main.js
- add vanilla/javadocs.html

### Misc Stuff
- Mental model of what training for a job as a programmer is like: 
    - the process of getting a job as a programmer  
    is not so different from getting a job as a taxi driver  
    - if you've never driven/programmed before, you start in the parking lot learning core skills/concepts that you'll use everywhere else  
    - getting out of the parking lot is doing personal projects (where you dream up the desired behavior)  
    - once you've gotten out of the parking lot on your own and are comfortable with driving around, then you can apply for a programming job  
    - core skills/concepts:
        - javascript concepts
            - variable, if, for, function, class, etc.  
        - inner skills
            - mentally run code, text manipulation, how to combine concepts, self documenting code, etc.  
        - outer skills
            - setup, git, npm, googling, hosting, etc.  
        - html concepts
            - elements, built in attributes, css selectors & declarations, etc.
