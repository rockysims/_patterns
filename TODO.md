### In Progress
- heroku hosting guide

### TODO
- update js concept files to use both let and const (instead of just let)

### Wish List
- common ide text manipulation/navigation tactics with exercises
- coding exercises needing only patterns demonstrated here
- walkthrough for deploying to free web hosting (heroku.com?)
- vscode setup guide on youtube with timestamps to the 
    micro demonstrations:
    - download and install
    - update the settings (via settings.json file?)
    - settings change: save on lose focus
    - shortcut change: for navigate forward/backward to opt + cmd + rigth/left arrow (and delete old meanings)
    - create new project
    - create new file
    - create index.html and add main.js
- add vanilla/javadocs.html

### Misc Stuff
- Mental model of what training for a job as a programmer is like: 
    - the process of getting a job as a programmer  
    is not so different from getting a job as a taxi driver  
    - if you've never driven/programmed before, you start in the parking lot learning core skills/concepts that you'll use everywhere else  
    - getting out of the parking lot is doing personal projects (where you dream up the desired behavior)  
    - once you've gotten out of the parking lot on your own and are comfortable with driving around, then you can apply for a programming job  
    - core skills/concepts:
        - javascript concepts
            - variable, if, for, function, class, etc.  
        - inner skills
            - mentally run code, text manipulation, how to combine concepts, self documenting code, etc.  
        - outer skills
            - setup, git, npm, googling, hosting, etc.  
        - html concepts
            - elements, built in attributes, css selectors & declarations, etc.
