### Description
Common coding patterns for new programmers to copy.  
Focused on html, css, and javascript.  

### Where to start
1. [Download](https://github.com/rockysims/_patterns/archive/master.zip) the master branch and unzip it.
2. Open vanilla/_start.html in a browser.
3. Compare the html file with the browser console.
4. Play with the code until you understand what it's doing.
5. Go on to the next html file (and repeat from step 3).

### Guiding Principles
- Hands on. A runnable, editable file for each concept.
- Show don't tell. Avoid explanations written in english.
- Design for copy & paste. Minimal, self explanatory examples.
- Prioritize density. Exclude less common variations and avoid repetition.
- Assume the reader has seen it all before but needs a reminder.

### Wish List
- common ide text manipulation/navigation tactics with exercises
- coding exercises needing only patterns demonstrated here
- walkthrough for deploying to free web hosting (heroku.com?)
- vscode setup guide on youtube with timestamps to the 
    micro demonstrations:
    - download and install
    - update the settings (via settings.json file?)
    - settings change: save on lose focus
    - shortcut change: for navigate forward/backward to opt + cmd + rigth/left arrow (and delete old meanings)
    - create new project
    - create new file
    - create index.html and add main.js
- add vanilla/javadocs.html
